Starting out as a few simple prototypes to test a realtime physics system I was working on, this project became a bit of an obsession for me as I tinkered with constraints and designed various components of jellyfish anatomy. Being a physically based simulation, minimal input (a user can tap/click the hood to emit a nudging force, and the hood muscles are continuously expanding and contracting) results in complex organic movement which can be quite mesmerizing. As a technical aside, all geometry and physical constraints are procedurally generated through hand-coded methods, which was fairly tedious. In future work, I hope to develop tools for automating or graphically editing simulation constraints to allow quicker iteration on ideas with a balance between creative freedom and technical tedium, making this process more accessible to others as well as my future self.

> _Surrealist horror voodoo doll; nonsensical phrase generator_

Spawned in response to (and named after) a [Tumblr stream](http://dinild.tumblr.com) featuring strangely grotesque photo composites, this piece provides a novel interface for generating nonsensical phrases: through interaction with a digital entity conceptually similar to a voodoo doll. Each selection is made by inserting a crystalline needle into the surface of the doll head, creating a string of short phrases over time in order of insertion. Although based on a political figure, I see this experience as an abstract commentary on control and manipulation, as well as an  auditory/visual exploration of the grotesque. My initial aim was to develop a system capable of synthesizing arbitrary words and phrases from a limited set of predefined sounds and their corresponding mouth shapes; the final piece is more limited, with predefined words composed of a limited set of primary mouth shapes with accompanying audio. It would be interesting to apply machine learning methodologies to blend mouth shapes based on input syllables; although I currently have limited knowledge of this field, I hope to explore it more as the technology becomes more accessible.
